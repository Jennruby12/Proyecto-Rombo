# Rhombus Project 

## Description
This project is developed in C# and aims to calculate the area of a rhombus. The application allows the user to input the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus, and it calculates the area based on the mathematical formula:

\[
Area = \frac{d_1 \times d_2}{2}
\]

Where:
- \(d_1\) is the length of the first diagonal.
- \(d_2\) is the length of the second diagonal.

This project demonstrates basic C# programming concepts, such as working with variables, user input, and performing mathematical operations. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and is designed to be simple and easy to understand.
