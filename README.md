# Rhombus Project 

## Description
This project is developed in C# and aims to calculate the area of a rhombus. The application allows the user to input the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus, and it calculates the area based on the mathematical formula:

#### Area Method
The `Area` method calculates the area of a rhombus, given the lengths of the two diagonals. The formula for the area is:

\[
A = \frac{\text{Diagonal mayor} \times \text{Diagonal menor}}{2}
\]

Where:
- `Diagonal_M` is the length of the larger diagonal.
- `Diagonal_m` is the length of the smaller diagonal.


This project demonstrates basic C# programming concepts, such as working with variables, user input, and performing mathematical operations. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and is designed to be simple and easy to understand.
